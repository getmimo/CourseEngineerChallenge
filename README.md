## Step 1
Get the Mimo app [getmimo.com/download](getmimo.com/download) and complete the Programming 1 and 2 courses. If you don’t have an iOS device, try to borrow one from a friend or family member. Don’t continue to step 2 unless you’ve completed the courses.

## Step 2
Read the Course Engineer’s Style Guide (provided separately), which describes how we write courses at Mimo.

## Step 3
Keeping the Style Guide handy, find the flaws in these lessons. Please note that we’ve taken these screenshots in the Course Builder, which means they may look a little different than in the Mimo app.


### Question 1:
![Lesson 1](https://github.com/getmimo/CourseEngineerChallenge/blob/master/CourseEngineerChallenge01.png)

- [ ] “function" is formatted as inline code
- [ ] “argument" and “arguments" are in bold
- [ ] The code block contains a syntax error
- [ ] The introduction uses a passive voice


### Question 2:
![Lesson 2](https://github.com/getmimo/CourseEngineerChallenge/blob/master/CourseEngineerChallenge02.png)

- [ ] The code block contains a syntax error
- [ ] "getcwd()" is not formatted as inline code
- [ ] The feedback uses a passive voice
- [ ] The introduction is too long


### Question 3:
![Lesson 3](https://github.com/getmimo/CourseEngineerChallenge/blob/master/CourseEngineerChallenge03.png)

- [ ] The code block contains a syntax error
- [ ] The lesson doesn’t use contractions
- [ ] “condition” is formatted in bold 
- [ ] The feedback is too long


## Step 4
We’re not very happy with the password cracking chapter of the cybersecurity course, because
it suggests that hard-to-remember passwords are better (see: easy to remember, hard to guess)
it doesn’t call brute-force attacks by their name and it only mentions dictionary attacks in passing

Your final task is to improve this chapter.

Start with research on password cracking and make a list of resources to come back to. Then summarize your research phase in a few sentences. How did you find the resources? Which resources did you include for what reason? Which resources did you exclude for what reason?

Then draft the following changes in a text editor or word processor using the interactive elements you’ve encountered in the programming courses.

Before the “Online dictionary attacks” lesson, create a “Brute-force attacks” lesson in which you explain brute-force attacks in the Mimo style and voice
Rewrite the “Online dictionary attacks” lesson starting from scratch to build on the “Brute-force attacks” lesson
After the “What’s a strong password?” lesson, create a “Hard-to-remember passwords” lesson in which you talk about the security issue behind hard-to-remember passwords and introduce “easy to remember, hard to guess”

## Bonus Step
Find and list other flaws in the password cracking chapter

## Final Step
Send the results of this exercise back to us no later than 24 hours after you’ve received them.
