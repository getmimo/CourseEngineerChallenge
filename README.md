# CourseEngineerChallenge

Welcome to the Course Engineer Challenge. The purpose of this exercise is to give you an idea of what it's like to be a Course Engineer at Mimo. Also, it's a great way for us to see if you can dive into something new within a short timeframe and explain it in an easy-to-understand way.

## Step 1
Get the Mimo app [getmimo.com/download](getmimo.com/download) for Android or iOS. Create an account and activate Mimo Premium with the coupon code we've sent you. Complete the JavaScript Basics course in the Become a Web Developer track. Seriously, complete it. Only continue to step 2 when you’ve completed the course.

## Step 2
Read the Course Engineer’s Style Guide we've sent you. It describes how we write content at Mimo, how we call or spell things, how we punctuate, and so forth.

## Step 3
Keeping the Style Guide handy, find the flaws in the exercises below. Please note that we’ve taken these screenshots in the Course Builder, which means they look a little different than in the Mimo app.


### Question 1:
![Exercise 1](https://github.com/getmimo/CourseEngineerChallenge/blob/master/CourseEngineerChallenge01.png)

- [ ] “function" is formatted as inline code
- [ ] “argument" and “arguments" are in bold
- [ ] The code block contains a syntax error
- [ ] The introduction uses a passive voice


### Question 2:
![Exercise 2](https://github.com/getmimo/CourseEngineerChallenge/blob/master/CourseEngineerChallenge02.png)

- [ ] The code block contains a syntax error
- [ ] "getcwd()" is not formatted as inline code
- [ ] The feedback uses a passive voice
- [ ] The introduction is too long


### Question 3:
![Exercise 3](https://github.com/getmimo/CourseEngineerChallenge/blob/master/CourseEngineerChallenge03.png)

- [ ] The code block contains a syntax error
- [ ] The exercise doesn’t use contractions
- [ ] “condition” is formatted in bold 
- [ ] The feedback is too long


## Step 4
We’re not that happy with the password cracking chapter of the Cybersecurity course, because
- it suggests that hard-to-remember passwords are better (see: easy to remember, hard to guess)
- it doesn’t call brute-force attacks by their name and it only mentions dictionary attacks in passing

Your task is to improve this chapter.

Start with research on password cracking and make a list of resources to come back to. Then summarize your research phase in a few sentences. How did you find the resources? Which resources did you include for what reason? Which resources did you exclude for what reason?

Then draft the following changes in a text editor or word processor using the interactive elements you’ve encountered in the programming courses.

Before the “Online dictionary attacks” exercise, create a “Brute-force attacks” exercise in which you explain brute-force attacks in the Mimo style and voice.

Rewrite the “Online dictionary attacks” exercise starting from scratch to build on the “Brute-force attacks” exercise.

After the “What’s a strong password?” exercise, create a “Hard-to-remember passwords” exercise in which you talk about the security issue behind hard-to-remember passwords and introduce “easy to remember, hard to guess”.

## Bonus Step
List other flaws and opportunities for improvement you found in the Mimo app.

## Final Step
Send the results of this exercise back to us no later than 24 hours after you’ve received them.
